Please consider the following when contributing to this repository:

* Implement BKKCrypt using your best knowledge. 
* Include code level documentation; document the WHYs and HOWs first, maybe the WHATs.
* Include unit tests.
* Add your name to the contributor list in the README.
* Consider adding TravisCI

Pull requests will only be accepted if (more-or-less;]) follow these rules, but will most probably be rejected if contain too many merge conflicts.
